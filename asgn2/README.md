PURPOSE: Math Estimation program

IMPORTANT: The Exp function sometimes takes a long time to complete.  If it appears that there is an infinite loop, wait and it will return the correct number

math.c: This is the file that has the code in it

Makefile: This file is used to compile the code

to run code: type "make clean", type "make", type "./math" followed by a program argument (e for exponential, s for sin, c for cos, t for tan, and a for all)
